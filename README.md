I just ran and pushed a template from Jetbrains Rider to create an ASP.NET Core Web Application with Angular 13
In the ClientApp directory, you can see the Angular files
In Controller directory, you can see a fake weather API to generate Data in Fetch API route.
In program.cs and weatherforecast.cs you'll find the C# files to control backend.
